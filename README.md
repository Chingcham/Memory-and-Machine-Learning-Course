# Overview

The aim of this course is to introduce computational, numerical and distributed memories from a theoretical and epistemological standpoint as well as neural networks and their use in cognitive science. Concerning machine learning, the course will focus on various model learners such as Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Model, Reinforcement Learning and Memory Networks.

# Target audience

This course is for Master 1 Science Cognitive and Applications (Master Erasmus Mundus â€“ University of Lorraine). This is an introduction course, assuming no prior knowledge of Machine Learning.

# Course Organization

- 30 hours = 10 work sessions of 3 hours/week
- Courses = half lectures / half exercises or practicals
- Evaluation: group projects (2 to 3 students/group)
- The last 2 (maybe 3) work sessions will be saved to work on the project
